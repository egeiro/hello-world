# hello-world
New test repository

## Thoughts
Was tossing up between using this github account or creating a new gitlab account.

Decided to pursue the github idea because many of the Hugo themes I have tried are managed through github. I'd like to work on creating my own theme so thought some versioning system/software would be useful to know!
